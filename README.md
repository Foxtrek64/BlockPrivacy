# BlockPrivacy

BlockPrivacy is a mod that allows for protecting your blocks, such as chests and doors, from unwanted visitors. The core idea is simple block protection with a familiar interface, but simultaneously allowing for advanced features.

Features (checkmark indicates completion):

- [ ] Identifies chests and doors by block type.
- [ ] Supports vanilla and modded doors and chests, or blocks which behave like them.
- [ ] Double doors open together.
- [ ] Protection Managers - Define other players which can add and remove people from the protection on your behalf.
- [ ] Protection Groups - Manage a large number of protections with a single command.
  - The Protection Group Owner is the only person (besides moderators with the appropriate permission) who can delete the protection group and add protection group managers.
  - Protection Group Managers can add and remove people from the group on behalf of the owner.
  - Protection Group Members can access any block that the group is added to.
  - Blocks can support multiple groups.
